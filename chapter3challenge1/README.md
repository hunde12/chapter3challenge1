# EcoLife Solutions Weather Widget

## Part 1: Brand Analysis & Design

### 1. Color Palette Selection
*   **Primary Color:** Forest Green (#2E8B57) - Represents nature, growth, and sustainability.
*   **Secondary Color:** Earthy Brown (#8B4513) - Represents soil and stability, grounding the design.
*   **Accent Color:** Sky Blue (#87CEEB) - Represents clean air and water, adding a fresh touch.

**Justification:** These natural tones align perfectly with EcoLife Solutions' mission of promoting sustainable living and environmental awareness. They create a warm, approachable, and organic feel.

### 2. Typography Strategy
*   **Headings/Titles:** "Merriweather" (Serif) - A warm, readable serif font that feels established and trustworthy, evoking a sense of nature and tradition.
*   **Body Text:** "Open Sans" (Sans-serif) - A clean, friendly, and highly legible font that complements the serif headings and ensures readability for data and tips.

**Justification:** The combination of a warm serif for headings and a clean sans-serif for body text creates a balance between approachability and modern clarity, fitting the "Eco-Friendly, Community-Focused" brand values.

### 3. Layout Sketch
*   **Root:** BorderPane
*   **Top:** City Name (Heading) + Search Bar
*   **Center:**
    *   Current Temperature (Large, Bold)
    *   Weather Condition (Text)
    *   Eco Icon (Leaf Shape) - Animated
    *   Gardening Tip / Air Quality Index
*   **Bottom:** 3-Day Forecast (HBox)

## Part 3: Reflection

### 1. Brand Alignment
The design uses natural colors and organic shapes (leaf) to immediately convey the environmental focus. The inclusion of gardening tips and air quality data directly addresses the needs of the target audience (urban gardeners, eco-conscious consumers).

### 2. CSS Architecture
External CSS is crucial because it allows for a clean separation of concerns. If the company decides to rebrand or if we were to implement the "Aero Dynamics" version, we could simply swap the CSS file (and potentially some minor layout tweaks) without rewriting the core logic. It ensures consistency across the application.

### 3. Integration Challenge
The most challenging part was ensuring the "Eco" specific features (like gardening tips) felt integrated into the weather display without cluttering the interface. Balancing the data-rich requirements with the "Approachable" brand value required careful spacing and font sizing.
